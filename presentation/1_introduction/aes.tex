\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The AES}

\begin{frame}[t]{History}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In 1997, NIST decided to deprecate DES and focus on DES3 while opening proposals for the new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (FIPS PUB 197).
		\item Several characteristics were mandatory for the candidate \cite{Paar2010understanding}:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Block cipher with 128 bit block size
				\item Three key lengths must be supported: 128, 192 and 256 bit.
				\item Security relative to other submitted algorithms.
				\item Efficiency in software and hardware
			\end{itemize}
		\item Candidates narrowed down to 5 in August of 1999.
		\item In October of 2000 NIST should announce the winner.
		\item In November of 2001, AES was formally approved as a \textbf{US federal standard}.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{The winner}
	In the end, the elegance, efficiency, security, and principled design of
	Rijndael won the day for its two Belgian designers, Joan Daemen and Vincent
	Rijmen.
