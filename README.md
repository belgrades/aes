## Goal

Inside Rijndael. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the arithmetic in Rijndael's finite field (underlying the AES blockcipher). 

## Steps 

Write a program (using your favourite programming language) able to:

1. Perform the basic operations in Rijndael's finite field, using the extended Euclidean algorithm for computing the multiplicative inverse of a polynomial.
1. Use your program to re-generate the AES S-Boxes (for both encryption and decryption).
